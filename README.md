Problem Statement 1:-

The data presented to you is from an online platform StayCatin.com that lets
you book properties for a particular date per your requirement (similar to
Airbnb).
You have joined the firm as a business analyst and have been asked to help the
business management make smart decisions. They have provided you with the
data, which lists down details of each property listed on their website, the
reviews and how the price fluctuated with time.

You need to come up with a dashboard that helps management answer the key
questions:
1. Top 10 earners
2. Relationship between price and earnings
3. Any location (shore) getting more earnings
4. Relationship between price and reviews
Create a storyboard with the insights also

Problem Statement 2:

You have been provided with the IPL Dataset. Go through the data set carefully and
answer the questions listed below, which will eventually guide you and give you some
insights about the same.
Before proceeding with solving the questions, make sure you follow the data processing
step mentioned below. (In the same excel sheet )

You have been provided with a IPL Dataset, but it has similar teams with multiple name,
for example Rising Pune Supergiants, Rising Pune Supergiant & Pune Warriors. In order
to remove redundancy from the dataset change the name of
● Rising Pune Supergiant, Pune Warriors => Rising Pune Supergiants
● Delhi Capitals => Delhi Daredevils
